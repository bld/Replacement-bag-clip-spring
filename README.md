Replacement bag clip spring
===========================

The plastic spring for one of my bag clips broke. This is a parametric replacement.

Instructions
------------

1. If your bag clip has a broken spring and is of this type, measure its dimensions and print. I used 3 perimeters and 100% infill for strength. Seems to work fine with PLA because of the small flex required.
2. Put the two halves of the clip together.
3. Insert spring between handles.
4. Press until it snaps into place.
